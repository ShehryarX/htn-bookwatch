## Hack the North: Bookwatch Android Application

An experimental app for Android that performs optical character recognition (OCR) on images captured using the device camera.

Runs the Tesseract OCR engine using Tesseract. Several open source and private projects such as translation services like Google Translate were also used in the process.

## Requires
* A Google Translate API key (for translation) - [Documentation](https://code.google.com/apis/console/?api=translate)
* A Windows Azure Marketplace Client ID and Client Secret (for translation) - [Documentation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh454950.aspx)

## Training data for OCR

A data file is used to identify and translate between various languages. By default, English has been included.

You can download additional language translations through browsing the Google Code library on its Github page.

## Installation

To build and run the app, clone this project, open it as an existing project in Android Studio, and click Run.
